[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. This is a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Running the program:

The entry point for your HTTP server implementation is in `src/server.cpp`.
1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally
2. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/server.cpp`.

#todo: write documentation!!
